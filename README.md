# Eventography
Attention all event organizers and hosts! Tired of missing out on those epic moments captured by your guests because they never get around to sharing them individually? Sick of receiving grainy, low-quality snaps and videos via WhatsApp or Messages? Say goodbye to those headaches because Eventography is here to revolutionize your event experience!

With Eventography, you can wave goodbye to the hassle of chasing guests for their media. Picture this: a centralized event page where all your attendees can effortlessly upload their photos and videos. It's a breeze! They simply select their best shots from their phone and zip them over to our ultra-secure server powered by Cloudinary.

Another cool feature of Eventography is the content moderation using Amazon Rekognition to prevent image or violence or nudity uploaded to your event.
